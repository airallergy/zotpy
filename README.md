# zotpy

This is a repository of supplementary tools to assist the use of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and its [plugins](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) via [Pyzotero](https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero).

## Tools

- **Unlinked Files Removal**

    This is to resolve situations when attachment files are left behind whilst their formerly linked entries have been deleted from the Zotero library. This happens when the [Linked Files](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files#stored_files_and_linked_files) function is used, most likely with [ZotFile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile).
