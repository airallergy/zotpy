# ZotUtil

This is a repository of utilities to assist the use of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) and its [plugins](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) via [pyzotero](https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero).

## Utilities

- **Unlinked Files Removal** (In Progress)
  - Removal, Deletion, Recovery
  - Empty Directory Deletion

    This is to resolve situations when attachment files are left behind whilst their formerly linked entries have been deleted from the Zotero library. This happens when the [Linked Files](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files#stored_files_and_linked_files) is used, most likely together with [ZotFile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile).

- **Tags Case Unification** (To Do)

    This is to resolve situations when literally same tags co-exist in different cases (e.g. energy & Energy), due to diverse bibliography imported sources and the case sensitivity in Zotero. Some regard this as a feature whilst others, a bug, see discussion [here](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/comment/317212).
