Variable Naming Rules
---------------------
Pattern:
    path : file path as a `pathlib.Path` object.
    directory : folder path as a `pathlib.Path` object.
    item : uncertain file or folder path as a `pathlib.Path` object.

Exception :
    `path` or `directory` in function arguments can be a `str` object as well.
